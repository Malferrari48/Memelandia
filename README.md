# Memelandia
This project was carried out by Francesco Malferrari (me) for the Unimore course of "Web Technologies" during July / September 2022 through the famous Django framework.<br>
It was very free in terms of themes, as long as I respected some essential constraints for a website (registration, login, etc ...), and I chose to create a social network dedicated to memes.
In particular, I focused on the creation, sharing and research of memes, there is also the interaction between the various users registered on the site, such as like, dislike, comment, symmetrical friendship relations and chat.
For more details, I invite you to read the document "Memelandia report.pdf"; while if you want to download the code you can read the README.txt inside the project folder.
The final grade was 27.
